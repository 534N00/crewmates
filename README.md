## Notes

Thanks to ChatGPT the only real issue was CSS. I was hopign to center the content down the middle but I just couldn't get it to do that no mater what I tried and I never figured it out, so I just gave up and moved on. Everything else was something I was able to figure out with some good prompt engineering and usage of past WEB 102 lectures.
